# Technician Activity Tab - Empty Issue Fix

## 🐛 Problem
Technician submitted a quote but the Activity tab shows empty (no requests visible).

## 🔍 Root Cause
The `getUserServiceRequests()` API was designed for **customers** only:
- It filters by `CustomerId` parameter
- Technicians don't have service requests as customers
- Technicians are linked to requests through **ServiceDeliveryOffers** (quotes)

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Modified `getUserServiceRequests()` Logic
**File:** `lib/api/serviceRequests.ts`

Added role detection:
```typescript
// For technicians, get requests where they have submitted offers
if (userData.userType === 'technician') {
  return await this.getTechnicianServiceRequests(userData.id);
}

// For customers, filter by CustomerId (existing logic)
```

### 2. Created `getTechnicianServiceRequests()` Method
**New private method in `lib/api/serviceRequests.ts`**

**Flow:**
```
1. Fetch all offers from technician
   GET /api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers?TechnicianId={id}
   ↓
2. Extract unique serviceRequestIds from offers
   ↓
3. Fetch each service request by ID
   GET /api/v1/serviceRequests/{requestId}
   ↓
4. Return combined list of requests
```

**Implementation:**
```typescript
private async getTechnicianServiceRequests(technicianId: string) {
  // Step 1: Get offers
  const offersUrl = `${API_ENDPOINTS.SERVICE_DELIVERY_OFFERS.BASE}?TechnicianId=${technicianId}`;
  const offersResponse = await fetch(offersUrl, { ... });
  
  // Step 2: Extract request IDs
  const requestIds = [...new Set(offersData.data.map(offer => offer.serviceRequestId))];
  
  // Step 3: Fetch each request
  for (const requestId of requestIds) {
    const request = await apiService.get(`/api/v1/serviceRequests/${requestId}`);
    requests.push(request.data);
  }
  
  return requests;
}
```

### 3. Added API Endpoints
**File:** `lib/api/config.ts`

```typescript
SERVICE_DELIVERY_OFFERS: {
  BASE: '/api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers',
  CREATE: '/api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers',
  GET_BY_ID: (id: string) => `/api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers/${id}`,
  ACCEPT: (id: string) => `/api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers/${id}/accept`,
  REJECT: (id: string) => `/api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers/${id}/reject`,
}
```

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
**File:** `components/TechnicianActivityContent.tsx`

Added detailed logging to track:
- Number of requests loaded
- First request sample data
- State updates

```typescript
if (__DEV__) {
  console.log(`✅ [TechnicianActivity] Loaded ${response.length} requests`);
  if (response.length > 0) {
    console.log('📋 First request:', {
      id: response[0].requestID,
      description: response[0].serviceDescription,
      status: response[0].status
    });
  }
}
```

## 📋 API Calls Flow

### For Customer
```
GET /api/v1/serviceRequests?CustomerId={customerId}
```

### For Technician (NEW)
```
1. GET /api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers?TechnicianId={technicianId}
   Returns: [
     { offerID, serviceRequestId, ... },
     { offerID, serviceRequestId, ... }
   ]

2. For each unique serviceRequestId:
   GET /api/v1/serviceRequests/{requestId}
   Returns: { requestID, serviceDescription, status, ... }

3. Combine all requests into array
```

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Check Console Logs
Look for these logs when opening Activity tab:
```
📥 [TechnicianActivity] Loading service requests...
🔧 Fetching requests for technician via offers...
📥 Fetching technician offers: /api/v1/serviceDeliveryOffers?TechnicianId={id}
✅ Found X offers
📋 Fetching Y unique service requests
✅ Loaded Y service requests for technician
✅ [TechnicianActivity] Loaded Y requests
📊 [TechnicianActivity] Setting Y requests to state
```

### 2. Verify Data Display
- Activity tab should show requests where technician submitted quotes
- Each request card should display:
  - Service description
  - Customer name, phone, address
  - Status badge with color
  - Requested date

### 3. Test Interactions
- Pull-to-refresh should reload data
- Clicking request should navigate based on status:
  - ACCEPTED/QUOTED → quote-selection page
  - Other statuses → order-tracking page

## 🔧 Files Modified

1. **lib/api/serviceRequests.ts** (~90 lines added)
   - Modified `getUserServiceRequests()` with role detection
   - Added `getTechnicianServiceRequests()` private method

2. **lib/api/config.ts** (~10 lines added)
   - Added `SERVICE_DELIVERY_OFFERS` endpoints

3. **components/TechnicianActivityContent.tsx** (~15 lines modified)
   - Enhanced debug logging

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Multiple API Calls**
   - Fetches offers first, then each request individually
   - Could be optimized with a dedicated backend endpoint
   - Works fine for reasonable number of offers (<50)

2. **Error Handling**
   - If one request fails to load, continues with others
   - Empty array returned on any error (graceful degradation)

3. **Caching**
   - No caching implemented
   - Each tab switch refetches data
   - Consider adding cache for better performance

## 🚀 Future Improvements

### Option 1: Backend Endpoint (Recommended)
Create dedicated endpoint:
```
GET /api/v1/serviceRequests/technician
- Backend joins ServiceDeliveryOffers with ServiceRequests
- Returns requests where TechnicianId matches offers
- Single API call, much faster
```

### Option 2: GraphQL
Use GraphQL to fetch nested data in one query:
```graphql
query TechnicianRequests($technicianId: ID!) {
  serviceDeliveryOffers(technicianId: $technicianId) {
    offerId
    serviceRequest {
      requestID
      serviceDescription
      status
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Redis Cache
- Cache offers and requests with TTL
- Invalidate on new offer submission
- Reduce API calls significantly

## ✅ Summary

**Before:**
- ❌ Technician Activity tab always empty
- ❌ Only worked for customers with CustomerId filter
- ❌ No way to see submitted quotes

**After:**
- ✅ Technician sees all requests where they submitted offers
- ✅ Role-based logic (customer vs technician)
- ✅ Proper data loading with debug logs
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh works
- ✅ Graceful error handling

**Testing Result:**
- Technician submits quote → Should appear in Activity tab
- Multiple quotes → All associated requests shown
- Empty state → Shows when no offers submitted yet

Ready for testing! 🎉
