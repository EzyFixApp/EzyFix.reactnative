/**
 * CRITICAL FIX SUMMARY - React Hooks Error
 * 
 * Problem: "Rendered fewer hooks than expected"
 * Root Cause: Order of operations was wrong
 * 
 * ❌ WRONG ORDER (Before):
 * 1. Call hooks (useRouter, useCustomerAuth, useRef)
 * 2. Call useEffect
 * 3. Define functions (handleErrorClose, handleLoginPress) 
 * 4. Calculate values (shouldShowLoading, shouldRenderComponent)
 * 5. Return JSX
 * 
 * ✅ CORRECT ORDER (After):
 * 1. Call ALL hooks unconditionally at the top (useRouter, useCustomerAuth, useRef)
 * 2. Call ALL useEffects 
 * 3. Calculate values (shouldShowLoading, shouldRenderComponent)
 * 4. Define functions (handleErrorClose, handleLoginPress)
 * 5. Return JSX (no conditional returns)
 * 
 * Key Changes:
 * - Moved all hooks to absolute top
 * - Moved calculations before function definitions
 * - Removed ALL conditional returns
 * - Added displayName for better debugging
 * 
 * Result: Hooks are called in same order every render = No error!
